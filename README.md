# tensorflow_learn

A growing set of small Tensorflow examples, very basic for the foreseeable time.
Hopefully they will help me to gradually get a grip on what exactly tensorflow is.
Feel free to copy, use in explanatory material etc.

I am amazed that neural nets really took us somewhere.
Wouldn't have thought that in the 60's, with all the hippie-babble about perceptrons.
