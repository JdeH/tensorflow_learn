# tensorflow_learn

A growing set of small Tensorflow examples, very basic for the foreseeable time.
Feel free to copy, use in explanatory material etc.

Hopefully some experimenting will help at least me to gradually get a grip on what exactly Tensorflow is.
For now it seems like a quite general dataflow machine that could also be used for linear algebra, image processing etc.
And the data that flows are tensors (vectors with an arbitrary number of dimensions).
So: 'tensor'-flow, quite logically.
The fun of the dataflow approach is that it can be applied massively parallel, so on your graphics card.
They people that made it have built that in almost right from the start.

I can imagine why it's becoming quite popular.
Don't know why it only seems to be popular in conjunction with neural nets, however.
Perhaps because they require a lot of computation?
But surely something like the Floyd-Warshall all points shortest path algorithm could also greatly benefit from it.

So, enough room for curiosity and experimenting.
